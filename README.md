# csc492

Please do make any changes in the development branch. The main branch will be used for deployment.
Plan is to deploy results to website. Couple possibilities for that:
1. Have visualizations that show model predictions at the end of each day, as well as charts and graphs that show past model performance
2. Make makeshift policy for model and have it trade with real money in a paper trading environment (specifically Alpaca), where paper trading environment mirrors live environment
